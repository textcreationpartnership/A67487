            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THAT Your unfortunate Petitioner having loſt her Husband and five Brothers in His Majeſties ſervice in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had therefore all her worldly Subſtance ſeized and Taken from her, in which deplorable Condition your Petitioners Aged Mother, who lay ready to ſink under the Oppreſſion of too Juſt a Grief for the Loſs of all her Sons, was with her Children fired out of your Petitioners Houſe, and after Expoſed to all the Miſery Imaginable: From which diſtreſſed Condition ſhe and thoſe Orphans at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make their Eſcapes to <hi>Cork,</hi> or where ever elſe their pitty leſs Fortune ſhould lead them; but the Enemy ſoon purſued their unhappy Wondering Lives, and with an inflexible Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty barbarouſly Murthered one of your Petitioners Brothers; But to him was more Mercifully Cruel then to the reſt: For your Petitioners Aged Mother, Siſter and Children, they Stript even of their very Shifts, with the Terrour and Cold of which her Siſter and Child died in the Field, and by the hardſhip they endured ſhortened the lives of ſeveral of your Petitioners own Children alſo, and the Miſerable ſurvivors of them lay a Conſiderable time in a very week Condition, in the Ruines of ſome old Walls in a Waſt and deſolate part of the Country, where the ſenſe of their Miſeries was Cruſh'd by the ſaid wait of peoples own Misfortunes, till General <hi>Ginkell,</hi> under whoſe Command your Petitioners friends were Loſt, joyn'd with the Government of that Kingdom in repreſenting the hardſhips of their Caſe to their Majeſties, who in Compaſſion to their Misfortunes was Graciouſly pleaſed to Grant Your Petitioner for the ſupport of her ſelf and Children, a Pention of Two hundred pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> to be Continued to her and them, as appears by the Expreſs words of the Patent, as well as the annext Certificate of my Lord <hi>Rumney</hi>'s, till their Majeſties could make ſome better proviſion for them, or Give ſomething more Conſiderable and better in lieu of it, in Conſideration of their great Sufferings, in Order to which His Majeſty was Graciouſly pleaſed about three Years ſince, to accept of a Surrender of the ſaid Pention, and did in lieu of it, and in Order to a farther Grant, Give you Petitioner a Cuſtodiam for three Years of Lands of the ſame Yearly Vallue; but your Petitioner, whoſe unhappy fate too much reſembles that of her unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Families, had moſt of thoſe little broken pieces of Land taken from her by other Peoples Agents, which ſhe with great Charge, and Dificulty found out; and being then deprived both of Land and Pention together, His Majeſty therefore laſt Spring was Graciouſly pleaſed, upon the Government of <hi>Irelands</hi> report, and repreſentation of the hardſhip of your Petitioners Caſe, who prayed His Majeſty to accept of a Surrender of the ſaid Cuſtodiam, and to Grant her in lieu of it, and of the Pention ſhe had Surrendred, a Leaſe of Ninty nine Years of the above mentioned Two hundred pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> out of the Forfeited Eſtates; upon which His Majeſty, according to His firſt Intentions, was pleaſed to Grant Your Petitioners Requeſt, by giving his Letter, which directed them to find Your Petitioner as many of the Forfeited Lands as ſhould amount to the Clear Yearly Vallue of Two hundred pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> which the Government there has accordingly done; But Your Petitioner being unfortunate in all things, is afraid ſhe ſhall ſtill meet with the ſame Fate, and be Excluded from the Favour and Compaſſionate Conſideration of this Honourable Houſe; which ſevear Decree would ſoon Compleat the Ruin of Your Petitioner and Children, whoſe ſufferings already have been, God knows, too Cruel to be pattern'd among the Worſt of their Country: Therefore Your Petitioner humbly hopes, that Your Honours will not look upon her Caſe as a Common one, having beſides the firſt Dear Purchaſe, given a Valluable Conſideration for this ſmall Eſtate, beſides the Expence and Attendance of ſeven or eight Voiages, too and from that Kingdom, in Obtaining, Fixing and Exchanging thoſe Grants, which has not only Eaten up the benefit of His Majeſties Intended Bounty, but Coſt Your Petitioner from firſt to Laſt, twice more then the Inheritance of ſo ſmall a Grant can poſſibly be worth; all which, together with three Years Loſs of the Income of her Pention, Your Petitioner humbly Submits to Your Honours Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And humbly prays, Your Honours will in Conſideration of her great Sufferings, and of the Pention which ſhe has Surrendred, propoſe ſome way to Eſtabliſh her and her Children, who otherwiſe muſt Inevitably periſh, in their Grant of Two hundred pounds</hi> per Ann. <hi>together with what in Your Wiſdoms Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhall think proper towards the vaſt Charge Your Petioner has been at, and the Loſs of ſo many Years Income of her Pention, all which appears by the Lords Juſtices Report ready to be produced; and Your Petitioner who has ſmarted under a Succeſſion of Trouble and Affliction of the heavieſt kind, humbly hopes Your Honours will not aſſign her Miſeries a Longer date, nor think her requeſt touching thoſe Lands unreaſonable, ſince her neareſt and deareſt Relations have Contributed to the recovery of them, with the Loſs of their Lives and Fourtunes and utter ruin of their Families, and that it was Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perticular deſire of ever Bleſſed Memory, as well as Her declared intentions to the Lord Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that a better Proviſion and more ſuitable to her Sufferings ſhould be made in a more Convenient time for Your Petitioner and Children as appears by his Lordſhips annext Certificate. Your Petitioner therefore humbly begs this Honourable Houſe will be pleaſed in ſome kind or other to fulfil Her Majeſties deſires and Gracious Intentions, and not ſuffer Your Petitioners hopes after ſuch a Scene of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, to be at Laſt buried in the ſame Grave with her Royal and bountious benefactor.</hi>
